# Lesion-Annotation-Free-WSI-Classification-with-Mutual-Calibration-Training
A deep learning framework for skin lesion classification on whole slide images (WSIs) without lesion-level annotations. Integrating weakly supervised learning and mutual calibration with noise-aware labeling, it achieves 82.29% accuracy across 14 lesion types, improving performance by 3.6% over the baseline.
